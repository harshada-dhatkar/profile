My skills
What My Dancing Skills Included?
I am a skilled Kathak dancer with deep classical expertise, specializing in intricate footwork, fast spins (chakkars), and expressive storytelling (abhinaya). I excel in mastering complex rhythmic patterns (taals) and synchronizing with classical instruments like the tabla. My performances are characterized by grace and precision, using refined gestures (mudras), facial expressions, and eye movements (drishti bheda) to convey emotion. With a strong command of dynamic footwork (tatkar) and stamina, I am adept at choreographing both traditional and contemporary Kathak pieces, excelling in solo and group performances with captivating stage presence.
